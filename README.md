   Depends:
   ~jquery.js
 
   How to use:
	
1.	Create div elements with the "tile-swap" class (The div must have a position value of "relative","fixed","absolute" and must have a width and height in px)
	
2.	Give the div the "data-tile-width" attribute with the width of tile you want in px
	
3.	Give the div the "data-tile-height" attribute with the height of tile you want in px
	
4.	For automatic tile swapping give the div the "data-tile-speed" attribute with a time value in milliseconds
	
5.	Inside of the div create any number of img elements to be used (For manual tile swapping the images will cycle in the order in which they appear within the div)
	
6.	Make sure to provide a width and height attribute for each img element
